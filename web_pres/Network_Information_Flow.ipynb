The symmetric butterfly network consists of 2 sources ($S_{A}$, $S_B$), one relay ($R$) and 2 destinations ($D_A$, $D_B$). The Source $S_{A}$ (likewise for $S_{B}$) wants to transmit their data $d_{A}$ to its respective destination $D_{A}$. There are no direct links $S_A\\to D_A$ and $S_B\\to D_B$ and thus the information must be passed through the relay."

On the other hand, the demand on BC channel is $2N$ bits/symbol in case of routing $d_R = (d_A, d_B)$, while network coding needs only $N$ bits/symbol $d_R = d_A\\oplus d_B$, where $\\oplus$ denotes GF addtion."
